# weather_app
go to releases button to download


notes:
note: build folder isn't on github as was too big to transfer at once (can get from onedrive instead)

releases are all as release flutter apks instead of debug bc otherwise doesn't work on mobile data:
flutter build apk --release
(instead of in debug mode)
